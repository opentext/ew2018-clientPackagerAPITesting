## Practical Session 1: Creating an running a build with the AppWorks Client Packager API

In this practical session we will be using the SOAP UI tool to make HTTP requests against the AppWorks Client Packager API. This API is used to customize the AppWorks mobile client allowing for customizations to:

- Look and feel
- AppWorks (hybrid) app management and wrapping
- Deployment behavior (anonymous mode etc)

Client Packager Build jobs combine mobile app templates with user customization to produce bespoke results. These results can be deployed directly to the App/Play store.

## Session Steps

1. Create a Custom App
2. Pick template
3. Create an App Variant
4. Create Build Job
5. Run Build Job
6. Monitor job and collect app

## Session Outcome
After this session we expect the participant should be familiar with the AppWorks Client Packager and its role in the development process. They should also see the benefit of using tools such as SOAP UI for things like, automated API testing and API verification during development.

## Summary

An exploration of AppWorks Client Packager API (use for producing customised AppWorks mobile apps) using the SOAP UI REST tool.
